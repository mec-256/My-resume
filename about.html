      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>M.V.M Eswar Chandra</strong>, a 17-year-old aspiring web developer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at Mahindra University. I’m deeply passionate about using technology to create meaningful and interactive web experiences.</p>

      <p>My journey into tech began with a fascination for how the web works — and since then, I’ve immersed myself in front-end development, programming, and design. Every project I build helps me push boundaries, sharpen my skills, and grow as both a learner and developer.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">My Journey</h3>
      <p>At Mahindra University, I’ve built a strong technical foundation by exploring data structures, web technologies, and collaborative development. Working on projects has helped me not only develop coding skills but also learn how to solve real-world problems creatively.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Adaptability & Learning</h3>
      <p>I’m someone who takes a bit of time to settle into new environments, but once I do, I engage deeply and give my 100%. This adaptability has helped me overcome technical challenges, learn fast, and stay motivated.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Beyond Tech</h3>
      <p>Outside coding, I enjoy sports, hobbies, and connecting with people — experiences that keep me grounded and creative. I believe that building great tech also requires a human touch and a well-rounded perspective.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Let’s Connect</h3>
      <p>I’m excited to learn from and work with people in the tech community. If you’re building something cool, exploring web dev, or want to collaborate — I’d love to chat!</p>
